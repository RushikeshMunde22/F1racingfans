            <h3>75th Anniversary</h3>
            <p>The 2025 season is a monumental milestone, marking the 75th anniversary of the FIA Formula One World Championship. Since the very first race at Silverstone in 1950, the sport has evolved from a niche European competition into a global sporting phenomenon.</p>
            <p>To celebrate this diamond jubilee, Formula 1 has planned a series of special events throughout the year. The calendar itself remains robust with 24 rounds, beginning with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne, restoring the traditional season opener slot. This year serves as a bridge between the current era and the major regulation overhaul coming in 2026, making it a crucial year for teams to balance current performance with future development.</p>

            <h3>New Regulations</h3>
            <p>While the chassis regulations remain largely stable before the 2026 overhaul, 2025 introduces several key sporting and technical tweaks designed to improve the show and fairness. One of the most discussed changes is the removal of the bonus point for the fastest lap, a rule that has been in place since 2019. This change aims to prevent strategic pit stops late in the race purely for championship points manipulation.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the minimum driver weight has been increased to 82kg (including race gear). This seemingly small change has significant implications for taller drivers, allowing them to maintain a healthier physique without being penalized for their natural build relative to lighter competitors. Gearbox allocations have also been relaxed to allow teams more flexibility throughout the grueling 24-race calendar.</p>

            <h3>Driver Moves</h3>
            <p>The 2025 grid features one of the most shocking transfer moves in Formula 1 history. Seven-time World Champion Lewis Hamilton has departed Mercedes after a legendary partnership to join Scuderia Ferrari, fulfilling a childhood dream and partnering with Charles Leclerc. This seismic shift has triggered a chain reaction across the paddock.</p>
            <p>Carlos Sainz, displaced by Hamilton, has moved to Williams, signaling a strong intent from the British team to return to the front. The grid also welcomes fresh blood, with highly rated rookie Kimi Antonelli stepping into the Mercedes seat, and Jack Doohan promoting to a race seat at Alpine. These moves create new rivalries and dynamics, ensuring that the battles off-track will be just as intense as the racing on-track.</p>
